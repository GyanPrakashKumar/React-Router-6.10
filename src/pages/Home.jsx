        Welcome to the home page. This is a simple example of a React Router
        DOM app.
        Here I have use the react-router-dom package to create a simple
        single-page application.
        This website has a few pages, and each page has a link to the other
        pages.
        The pages are rendered using React components.
        The components are rendered using the React Router DOM package.
        The React Router DOM package allows you to create a single-page
        application that uses the browser's history API to navigate between
        pages.

        search for jobs. The jobs are stored in a database. The database is a 
        JSON file. The JSON file is stored in a folder called data. The data 
        folder is in the root folder of the project.
